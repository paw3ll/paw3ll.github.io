      <h4>Post Grad</h4>
      <p>
      Post grad has been an experience. Going from having daily and weekly deadlines for course work on top of balancing a full time position
      to simply having a full time position has been challenging. It feels odd to have the foot off the gas and have more free time. Truth be told, 
      I miss it. I miss the expectations of gruesome projects or upcoming exams. The late nights studying and effort put to learn a foreign topic.
      
      It will be best if I am able to establish this "sense of urgency" for continued education and growth outside of academia so that I do not stagnate.
      
      Try to stay like a shark.
