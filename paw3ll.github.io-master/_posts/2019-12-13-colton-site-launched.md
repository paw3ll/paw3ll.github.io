      <h4>About the website</h4>
      <p>
        It has been several years now since the creation of my original website and since then I have learned a marginal amount. I wanted         to work towards creating a place I could call my own. So, here it is! <br><br>
        I intend to be editing this site, learning more about HTML and CSS, as well as blogging on this site much more over the years. A
        couple of things I want to include are: <ul>
        <li>Active Projects</li>
        <li>Powerlifting Training logs / Notes</li>
        <li>Book reviews / notes</li>
        <li>General Resources</li> </ul>
      </p>
